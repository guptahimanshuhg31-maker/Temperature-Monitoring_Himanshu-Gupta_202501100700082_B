Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to design and implement a Python program that simulates a temperature monitoring system.
The program should accept minimum and maximum temperature limits from the user, generate random temperature values at regular intervals, and display appropriate alert messages based on the comparison with the defined limits.

🛠️ Approach

The program accepts minimum and maximum temperature values from the user.

It generates random temperature values between 0 and 100 to simulate sensor data.

A delay of 2 seconds is introduced between each temperature reading.

Conditional statements are used to compare the generated temperature with the given limits.

Based on the comparison, suitable messages are displayed to indicate whether the temperature is high, low, or within the acceptable range.

🧪 Sample Output
Enter minimum temperature: 20
Enter maximum temperature: 40

Temperature: 55
Alert: Temperature is too high

Temperature: 15
Alert: Temperature is too low

Temperature: 30
Temperature is within acceptable limit
✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the basic use of Python concepts such as input handling, loops, conditional statements, random number generation, and time delay.
It provides a simple simulation of a temperature monitoring system and is suitable for beginner-level learning and academic submissions.
